This repository contains a number of UI components, reference implementations and other libraries that I find useful during the course of my regular consultancy and development engagements.

# js-callback-invoke

This simple (though vaguely) useful Vaadin 14 application displays a grid and some filters of the unclaimed estates held by the UK Treasury Solicitor (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/unclaimed-estates-list). 

It serves as a convenient starting point for creating examples and doing tests.
